\section{Model selection and adequacy}

Our best model, as selected via LOOIC and WAIC, is the parameter rich ``past and vary'' model which includes our historical covariantes and allows all regression parameters to vary through time (Table \ref{tab:selection}). Our best model is an improvement over the next best model by approximately 13 LOOIC and 24 WAIC points. However, the actual differences between these models are minor as revealed by the wide the standard errors. These results mean that while our ``past and vary'' model could be considered the best of the four, all four of the models are very close and only offer incremental improvement but not major differences.

    No past but vary & 12820.67 & 178.82 & 12817.49 & 178.77 \\

    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \label{tab:selection}
\end{table}

Comparison of the in-sample AUC estimates between the four models reveals similar results as the selection criteria (Fig. \ref{fig:roc_hist}). While the parameter rich ``past and vary'' model has the greatest mean AUC when compared to the other three models, the other three models are quite similar. We chose to base our conclusions on the parameter rich ``past and vary'' model but these comparisons of model selection and adequacy illustrate the very small gain in performance that is achieved by allowing parameter effects to vary through time and including the historical covariates, though it appears that each of these choices on their own yield approximately equivalent models.

Additional comparison of in-sample model performance at each of the time intervals reveals just how similar our four models are to each other (Fig. \ref{fig:roc_ts}). There are few if any obvious differences between the models in their performances.

Because of the parameter rich ``past and vary'' model displays some modest improvements over the other models we choose this model for all further analysis.

\section{Cross-validation}

The approximate out-of-sample predictive performance for our selected model, as measured by AUC, is approximately identical to our in-sample performance (Fig. \ref{fig:fold_auc}). The quality of performance, however, is not great, with average out-of-sample AUC estimated to be just above 0.7 which is far from perfect. This result means that while we expect our model to yield consistent results when provided with new data, we do not expect that our predictions will be very accurate.

Folds are labeled from oldest to youngest, with the oldest fold only being predicted by a single previous fold and the youngest fold being predicted by the four previous folds.}

\section{Parameter estimates}

The overall average probability of a species going extinct during any interval is very low (Fig. \ref{fig:effect_est}). This result means that even if covariate effects are very large on the log-odds scale, when compared on the probability scale will only produce a minor change in probability of extinction. This is one of the hardest parts of logistic regression for people to understand. Effect sizes are on the log-odds scale but prediction is on the probability scale. When the intercept term is very negative or positive (greater than 2), covariate effects are fighting over an increasingly small amount of probability. Logistic regressions are easiest to interpret when the intercept term is approximately 0; this is a fundamental difficulty of dealing with very uneven data sets.

As expected, a species with greater than average geographic range is expected to have a greater probability of surviving than a species with average or less than average geographic range (Fig. \ref{fig:effect_est})

We estimated an overall positive effect of the change in geographic range on extinction probability; this means that a species gaining in geographic range between that observation and their previous observed geographic range is associated with a greater extinction risk than a species which decreased in geographic range (Fig. \ref{fig:effect_est}). This sign of this result is consistent with virtually all previous analyses of the relation between geographic range and extinction.

We estimated an overall positive effect of both global temperature and the lag of global temperature with species extinction probability (Fig. \ref{fig:effect_est}. This type of effect means that when global temperature is above the Cenozoic average, we would expect higher than average extinction risk. Similarly, if global temperature was above the Cenozoic average in the time interval before the current one, we would also expect higher than average extinction risk. This means that during a run of above Cenozoic average global temperatures (2+ intervals) we would expect an even greater extinction risk than if just the current interval is of above average temperature. These results imply that, on average, the species during Paleogene had a greater extinction probability that species during the Neogene.

\end{figure}


The overall effect averages described above do not reflect the between time-interval variance of the effects. While the effect of geographic range has a consistent sign for the entire Cenozoic, the effects of the other covariates do not have a consistent sign (Fig. \ref{fig:effect_time_group}).

% variance components
There are multiple levels and sources of variance in our model. Each of the grouping factors account for some amount of variance in the data. The first ``level'' of variance is the data level or the variance in the observed data (the model response). In the context of regular linear regression, this variance is equivalent to the residual variance. In the context of logistic regression, however, this value is not an inherent part of the model.

There are then two non-nested sources of the second ``level'' of variance: intercept and slopes varying by time of observation, and a mean-zero age at observation varying intercept. Each of the elements of the vector of scale terms \(\tau_{B}\) describe the within-phyla variance for the intercept and the slope terms for the covariates. Similarly, the scale term \(\sigma_{a}\) is a scalar that describes the within-phyla variance of the effect of age at observation. 

The final ``level'' of variance the phyla-level: the between phyla variance for the intercepts and regression coefficients \(\tau_{\alpha}\), and the between phyla variance for the effect of age at observation \(\sigma_{\delta}\). 

The greatest source of variance accounted for by the grouping factors is the between phylum variance in the model intercept (Fig. \ref{fig:variance_components}); this is the first element of \(\tau_{B}\). All of the other scale terms have approximately equal estimates, which means that they contribute a similar amount to the structure underlying the data. For example, the within-phyla effect of geographic range on extinction probability is associated with approximately as much variance as there is between the phyla themselves.

This result means that, given this model, the greatest contributor to changes in extinction risk over time is when a species is present. In comparison, the covariates we studied individually contribute only a limited amount to the variation in extinction. Similarly, while age at observation does contribute to some differences in extinction risk (Fig XXX age effect), this effect is most likely overwhelmed by the importance of when that observation takes place.

  \caption{Contribution of multi-level components to unmodeled variance. Larger values indicate a greater contribution to overall variance. Variance components labeled as ``overall'' represent variance between grouping factors, while those labeled  ``within groups'' correspond to variance within grouping factors. If the overall component is greater than the within component, then the groupings do not structure the overall variance. If the within component is greater than the overall component, then the overall variance is structured by the groupings.}
