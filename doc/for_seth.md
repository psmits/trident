Presentation of results could be improved. Showing raw data of extinction rates in the four groups, and individual analyses how age and phyla actually influence extinction risk would be preferred over the wiggly lines in Figs. 2 and 3. The latter could be moved to the supplement. The text in the results section is very technical, describing too much detail. 

- **my comment on the above** figure 3 is more important than figure 2. our study is focused our ability to *predict*, not which things affect extinction. the reviewer seems confused by this. i'm including more figures in the supplement on average extinction risk and average covariate effects, along with their variance over time. i think the reviewer doesn't really understand what we did or are trying to do and i'm not equipped to fix this.


- l. 244-245. Poor reasoning. For example skeletal mineralogy (silica versus calcium carbonate), trophic level (phyto- vs. zooplankton), latitudinal preference (e.g., median paleolatitude) or additional physico-chemical parameters (e.g., sea-level, Mg/Ca, pCO2) are intuitive variables, whereas taxon-age is less intuitive in light of the recent literature. I’m not asking for additional analyses or more complex models but a sound rationale.
- l. 247. Add “for” between “not exist” and “all”. In any case, a poor defense given the obvious traits to look at (see above).

I find it interesting that the predictability of extinction doesn’t obviously differ between background intervals and intervals with more unusual environmental perturbations (such as the PETM or E-O transition). Perhaps that’s because those events weren’t mass extinctions in the vein of the P/T or K/Pg. There’s also a fair amount of volatility in the AUC time-series. Nevertheless, does this consistent predictive ability regardless of differences in conditions say anything interesting about extinction predictions?

The caveat that human impacts may dramatically alter extinction risk seems like an important one and, as it stands, seems like it could undercut the (rather terse) final conclusion. Would conservation decisions really be bolstered by including fossil data? I would agree with that (and of course I would, as a paleobiologist), but it might be useful to expand a bit on this topic. Do you mean that a model such as yours, incorporating geographic range and other such parameters, would be helpful? In what way could it be used? Or do you mean using models based on past intervals with environmental changes inferred to be similar – the PETM as an analogue for warming and acidification, for example? I wonder if it would be helpful to draw a stronger connection linking your finding to conservation biology, given the different stressors now.

6. I am not sure if it’s possible, but I am curious where geographic range or temperature are the key? Or both are essential? It is possible to try geographic range only model and temperature only model to see such?

8. While geographical range consider spatial stuff, the authors use one temperature curve for all (I understand there will be no other way). Is there any difference in temperature sensitivity between narrow and wide distribution species; or low latitude and high latitude species? I understand this may be out of the scope. The authors may ignore.
