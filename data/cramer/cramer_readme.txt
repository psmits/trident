Introduction:

This auxiliary material contains figures and tables relating to the temperature and ice volume trends shown in the manuscript. The first four figures are related to the compilation of benthic foraminiferal Mg/Ca analyses and calculation of the Cenozoic benthic foraminiferal Mg/Ca trend that appears in the text: the Mg/Ca data compilation and trends are shown in Figure S1, correlations among trends for separate taxa and the equations for adjustment to Oridorsalis equivalent values are shown in Figure S2, the waterdepth-dependent carbonate saturation effect is illustrated in Figure S3, and a compilation of d18O values that is equivalent in temporal and geographic distribution to the Mg/Ca compilation is shown in Figure S4. Figures S5 and S6 illustrate statistical tests for correlation of variability among the calculated temperature and ice volume trends. Figures S7, S8, and S9 provide alternate views of the temperature and ice volume trends presented in text Figures 6 and 9. Data tables are also provided for the complete compilation of Mg/Ca data (Table S1), the subset of Mg/Ca data used to calculate the Cenozoic trend (Table S2), the Cenozoic Mg/Ca trend (Table S3), the SLice and temperature trends calculated from combining NJSL and benthic d18O (Table S4), the temperature and d18Osw trends calculated from combining benthic Mg/Ca and d18O according to Equation 7a (Table S5), the temperature and d18Osw trends calculated from combining benthic Mg/Ca and d18O according to Equation 7b (Table S6), and the temperature and sea level trends for the late Miocene–Pleistocene calculated by scaling benthic d18O (Table S7). Note that in these data files seawater d18O values are relative to VPDB, although the data is plotted relative to VSMOW in the figures; the values can be converted to VSMOW by adding 0.27 per mil.

Figure S1. A: Compilation of published Mg/Cabf data with trend and 90% confidence envelope. B: Culled data used to calculate the trend used in our analysis, with 90% confidence envelope. C: Comparison of the trends from A and B, a trend calculated without correcting for waterdepth (Figure S3), and trends calculated for data separated by ocean basin.

Figure S2. A: Mg/Cabf trends calculated for individual species of benthic foraminifera. B: Correlation of Mg/Cabf trend for O. umbonatus to trends for other species. In contrast to the Mg/Cabf trend used for temperature analysis, trends in this figure were calculated as the median value in a 2 Myr window at 1 Myr resolution. Lines and equations shown in correlation plot show the correction used to adjust each species to O. umbonatus equivalent Mg/Cabf. These equations are based loosely on linear regression of the data shown, with consideration for minor differences among sites and variation in raw data density with age. Data shown were corrected for waterdepth according to Figure S3.

Figure S3. A: Mg/Cabf for all sites (i.e., analogous to Figure S1A) not corrected for water depth variations but corrected for species offsets as in Figure S2. The overall trend (black) is calculated by minimizing the offset needed to reconcile individual site trends (see Cramer et al. [2009] for description of this method). B: Residual values between trend and individual analyses. C: Water depth estimate for each Mg/Cabf analysis. D: Correlation of trend residuals from B with water depth from C. Trend residuals are shown for individual data as colored symbols; offsets used for each site to calculate overall trend are shown as thin black lines. Grey dots in background show Delta[CO3=] calculated for water samples from the modern ocean (database from eWOCE <http://www.ewoce.org/data/index.html#WHP_Bottle_Data> and calculation of Delta[CO3=] performed using Ocean Data View <http://odv.awi.de/>). Thick black line shows an exponential regression fit to modern ocean data: Delta[CO3=]=46.79-10.36•exp(0.4•waterdepth). E–H: equivalent plots for d18Obf data, shown to demonstrate that the trend in Mg/Cabf does not reflect a decrease in temperature with depth.

Figure S4. A: Compilation of published Pacific d18Obf data with trend and 90% confidence envelope (from Cramer et al. [2009]). B: Compilation of d18Obf with similar site distribution to that used to calculate the Mg/Cabf trend used for temperature analysis (Figure S1B). C: Comparison of the trends from A and B as well as a trend calculated for a compilation of d18Obf data with similar site distribution to the Mg/Cabf compilation in Figure S1A. Differences between trends from A and B are insignificant, indicating that our non-basin-specific Mg/Cabf trend with a Pacific d18Obf trend is valid.

Figure S5. Test of correlation between variability in separate temperature reconstructions (Td-SL and TMg/Ca) and separate ice volume reconstructions (IVSL and IVd-Mg/Ca). A: Fraction of variance explained by positive correlation between variability over a range of timescales in temperature (top) and ice volume (bottom), with significance levels for the null hypothesis that the observed correlation is a consequence of the imposed long-term trends on uncorrelated random data. Results for Equation 7a are shown in blue; results for Equation 7b are shown in orange. B-D: examples of the correlation for different timescales of variability (1, 10, 15, and 25 Myr). Changes in temperature (DeltaT) and ice volume proxies (DeltaSLice and Deltad18Osw) over different timescales were calculated by subtracting values at equal distance from each point (e.g., for 10 Myr timescale, the value at t+5 Ma was subtracted from the value at t-5 Ma for each t). Only reconstructions in the range 10–51 Ma were used; no Td-SL or IVSL reconstruction is available for the interval <10 Ma and TMg/Ca and IVd-Mg/Ca results >51 Ma are suspect (see main text). For each timescale, the fraction of variance explained by a positive correlation between temperature and ice volume change was calculated using singular value decomposition (SVD). A perfect positive correlation of the data would result in a value of 1 for the fraction of variance explained, a perfect negative correlation would result in a value of -1, and lack of any correlation would result in a value of 0.5. Data was not centered prior to SVD in order to test the null hypothesis that the observed correlation is a consequence of the long-term trends. Significance levels for rejecting this hypothesis were calculated with a bootstrap approach: synthetic datasets were calculated by phase randomization of the DeltaT, DeltaSLice, and Deltad18Osw data to preserve the frequency spectrum of the observed data (the Fourier transform of the original data was calculated, randomized phases were substituted, and the inverse Fourier transform was calculated). Significance levels indicate the fraction of values from synthetic datasets further from a value of 0.5; the levels can therefore be interpreted as the probability that a given correlation would be observed in random data having the same frequency spectrum as the reconstructed temperature and ice volume.

The analysis indicates that long-timescale variability (>30 Myr) simply reflects the long-term trends that result from our forcing the reconstructions to show minimal ice volume in the early Eocene; the high correlation is not significantly different from what would result by imposing a similar long-term trend on random data. The correlation for variability on timescales of 2–22 Myr is highly unlikely to be the consequence of imposing such a long-term trend. Some reconstructions indicate significant correlation of 22–30 Myr variability; no significant correlation is observed for variability <2 Myr.

Figure S6. Test of correlation between variability in temperature and ice volume reconstructions (top: Td-SL vs. IVSL; bottom: TMg/Ca vs. IVd-Mg/Ca). A: Fraction of variance explained by negative correlation between temperature and ice volume variability over a range of timescales, with significance levels for the null hypothesis that the observed correlation is a consequence of the imposed long-term trends on uncorrelated random data. Negative correlation is expected because ice volume is expected to increase with decreasing temperature. Results for Equation 7a are shown in blue; results for Equation 7b are shown in orange. B-D: examples of the calculation for different timescales of variability (1, 10, 15, and 25 Myr). Calculations were made as explained in the caption to Figure S5, except that the fraction of variance was calculated for the correlation of temperature and ice volume rather than the correlation of separate temperature reconstructions and separate ice volume proxies.

The analysis indicates that a significant negative correlation of temperature and ice volume variability occurs only on long timescales (>22 Myr). The observed negative correlation on timescales of ~5–22 Myr is not statistically significant except in the case of Equation 7b results: these show a negative correlation on timescales of 8–14 Myr that is significant at <0.10. Neither of the other sets of reconstructions shows a similar level of significance for the correlation on these timescales, so the results must be treated as ambiguous. All three sets of reconstructions show significant positive correlation at timescales <3 Myr (i.e., cooling is associated with ice volume decrease and warming is associated with ice volume increase on these timescales). The positive correlation at short timescales is the expected result of the calculations if the variability in underlying records is not compatible on these timescales: because Td-SL is calculated by subtracting IVSL from d18Obf and IVd-Mg/Ca is calculated by subtracting TMg/Ca from d18Obf, lack of correlation among IVSL, TMg/Ca, and d18Obf on short timescales will result in positive correlation between the resulting temperature and ice volume reconstructions.

Figure S7. Expanded view of the middle Miocene and Plio-Pleistocene climate transitions. TMg/Ca, Td-SL, IVd-Mg/Ca, and IVSL reconstructions are shown as in Figure 6 (thin lines and swaths) with the long-term variations from Figure 9 superimposed (thick lines). The high-resolution scaled d18O-based reconstructions of Miller et al. [2011] (shown as individual points) were smoothed to provide records equivalent to our reconstructions. We chose to concatenate the higher-frequency records of Td-SL and IVSL with the equivalent scaled d18O-based records as input for the lower-frequency smoothing (thick curves, also shown in Figure 9). The interval affected by this concatenation would otherwise be subject to end effects.
