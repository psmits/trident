Introduction

The auxiliary material contains all the new (previously unpublished) data presented in the manuscript above. There are three auxiliary data files:

Table S1: 
Core top benthic foraminiferal Mg/Ca with site information used in manuscript Figure 2a. These data are from Bryan and Marchitto [2008], Lear et al. [2002], and previously unpublished data.

Table S2:
Core top benthic foraminiferal Li/Ca with site information used in manuscript Figure 2b. These data are from Bryan and Marchitto [2008]. The carbonate saturation data for the sites have been corrected here for the addition of anthropogenic carbon.

Table S3:
Miocene data from Ocean Drilling Program Site 761. This file contains raw data (benthic foraminiferal Mg/Ca, Li/Ca, d18O, d13C and sediment % coarse values) and also calculated bottom water temperatures, bottom water saturation states and seawater d18O. These data are shown in manuscript Figures 3, 4 and 5, and are all previously unpublished.
